#Lux-Engine

###What is Lux-Engine?
Lux Engine is a DirectX11 Engine written in C++. The goal of Lux Engine is to be as bleeding edge as possible, just because I believe the point of creating any sort of engine is to allow it take full advantage of whatever hardware it is running on.

###Development
I've included the SLN for Visual Studios. Everything you need should already be in this repo. Just git clone and have at it.

I've divided the engine into a 4 part framework. System, Input, Graphics, and Main.
